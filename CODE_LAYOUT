## created 10/28/2013, unified code 
## CODE that starts from sorted bam file and does (1) split-read mapping (2) parses indels to generate list of candidate indels (3) realignment of individual reads using candidate list of indels and (4) output coordinate sorted and mate pair fixed (to some degree) bam file that can be used with CRISP or other tools..
indel_realigner_new.c

## functions for finding split-read mapping candidates, calling splitreadmapping code and realignment code 
detect_indels_buffer.c

## realignment changes starting/end position of reads -> update insert size, move reads in buffer to maintain sort and output reads from buffer to bam file
clean_sort_buffer.c

## cluster list of candidate indels and output indels with sufficient evidence to VCF file
printindels.c 

## code for functions for storing, clustering indels identified from parsing a bam/sam file as well as split-read alignment
## parse read with gapped alignment and print INDELS to VCF file 
indelfunctions.c indelfunctions.h

## data structures for storing bam RECORD | getting next read from BAM file | creating new BAM record after realignment | combine INDEL CIGARS for reads with complex indels 
bamread.c bamread.h

## compare aligned read (CIGAR) to a list of indel variants to do realignment (this is done left to right and right to left) 
bam_realign.c

## functions to compare CIGAR for each read and find new cigar after addition of indel event 
realignment.c 

## MAIN code for indel realignment using bam file and VCF file with list of known indels | calls bam_realing.c
indel_realigner.c

## clip ends of aligned cigar with many mismatches (do Smith waterman like model)
clipalignments.c

=======================================================================================================================

## CODE FOR EXTRACTING INDELS FROM sorted bam file and also doing BLAT-like split read indel discovery 
blatindelmapper.c

## code for generating k-mer hits, clustering | uses "findhits.c" and "clumphits.c"
splitreadmap.c

## dynamic programming to join together local hits into full alignment and change read->cigarlist if it is good alignment
clumphits.c

## SPLIT-read mapping code | find k-mer hits for a read and merge them into distinct clusters
findhits.c

## functions and datastructures for k-mer based table and matches list 
kmertable.c kmertable.h



## print program options 
print_options.c

## read VCF variants for indel realignment | generated by blatindelmapper.c 
readvariant.c  readvariant.h
